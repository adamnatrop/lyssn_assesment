This is my coding assesment for the Front End Developer position. 

Requirements: 
•	List each user, last name first, with each name capped
•	When a user is hovered over, the containing element must change color
•	Include a padding of 10px by 5px for each user
•	The display must be vertically and horizontally centered on the screen, and must remain so during screen resizing
